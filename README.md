# Brianna Cirillo's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Brianna Cirillo, a passionate data scientist and statistician with a solid foundation in mathematics and statistical analysis. My work focuses on applying advanced analytics to real-world problems, with experience in survival analysis, time series modeling, and predictive analytics.

## About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Monmouth University and a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I have maintained a 4.0 GPA.

Over the course of my academic and professional journey, I have developed strong analytical skills and proficiency in a wide range of tools, including R, Python, Minitab, SPSS, and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. My hands-on experience includes conducting statistical analyses of clinical trials, developing predictive models, and working with large datasets to draw meaningful conclusions. I am particularly skilled at leveraging survival analysis, time series analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques to generate actionable insights.

What drives me is the ability to blend technical expertise with a deep understanding of real-world issues to create impactful solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my knowledge to contribute to innovative projects, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and make meaningful contributions to the field of data science.

When I'm not diving into data, I enjoy working on creative side projects, mentoring others, and continuously learning about the latest advancements in analytics and technology.
